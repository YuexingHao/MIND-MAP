For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows.

On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104).

Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).Patient cellular phone photograph of the left eye shows an irregular serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia.Exploration of conjunctiva and removal of foreign body.</td>\n",

The patient also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection. For rapid bedside differentiation of multiple infectious etiologies, a Tzanck smear was performed by scraping the base of an ulcerated lesion and inner aspect of a pseudopustule and scraping its base with a #15 blade. These contents were placed on a glass slide, fixed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa and subsequently Papanicolaou staining to further characterize the changes seen.A, Clinical image demonstrating papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the elbows.

       "2  A 31-year-old man presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. He reported intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B).A, Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan of the head and neck at presentation showing a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm (arrowhead).

Examination of the mouth revealed multiple coalescing painless nonpruritic black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa. Examination of the skin was notable for erythematous and hyperpigmented patches covering 90% of the body surface area, consistent with her known mycosis fungoides. Other notable findings on examination were 1- to 2-cm lymphadenopathy in the bilateral inguinal folds and axillae. Review of systems was notable for fatigue. The patient had previously received 5 cycles of romidepsin with progression of disease, followed by 4 doses of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, which was followed by partial response.Black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa. .   \n",

Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).Patient cellular phone photograph of the left eye shows an irregular serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia.Exploration of conjunctiva and removal of foreign body.   \n",
