These paroxysmal episodes lasted a few seconds, occurred up to 20 times a day, and were exacerbated by external stimuli 5. There was no impairment of consciousness during the attacks 7. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use 8. She had hyperhidrosis and tachypnea on admission 9. Neurological examination results disclosed an abnormal mental status 11.
